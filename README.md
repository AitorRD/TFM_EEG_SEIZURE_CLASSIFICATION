## Data
The database consists of 14 folders containing EEG recordings in EDF format (European Data Format). Each folder refers to a specific subject including between 1 and 5 data files with a maximum size of 2.11 GB each, and a text file containing information on data and seizures. The edf files contain signals recorded on the same or different days and the seizure events are chronologically ordered. All dates in the .edf files are de-identified.
